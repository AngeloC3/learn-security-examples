Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The session secret "SOMESECRET" is stored in plain text in the code file in insecure.js, 
    whereas in secure.js, it is hidden in a process variable which makes the secret harder to be compromised.
    Additionally, secure.js uses httpOnly and sameSit as true, which helps protect against certain attcks.

Spoofing can violate the confidentiality principle since it can give someone access to sensitive information via 
    taking the indentity of someone with higher credentials / clearance. It also could violate the integrity principle,
    since the spoofer can use his false access to modify data.
