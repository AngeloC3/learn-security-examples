Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does info disclosure violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

Due to lack of sanitization and validation in insecure.js, injection attacks may occur. 
    The username query is used directly in the database with no sanitization. In secure.js, there is sanitization 
    which prevents that.

Info disclosure violates confidentiality due to an unathorized user gaining access to sensitive information.

You could incorporate an advanced user authentification system. You could also incorporate encryption to the data before storing
it in the database.
