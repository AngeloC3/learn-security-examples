- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

In insecure.js, there is a lack of propper logging for operations such as sending and getting messages which makes it hard to
    trace actions. In secure.js, there is a log stream which logs actions that will prevent repudiation.
    
You can create backup logs so that if there is an error with the log database, you still have the history. Additionally,    
    you can protect against tampering so attackers can't edit the logs to cover their tracks.
