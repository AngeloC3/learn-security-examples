- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

In insecure.js, the query in userinfo is directly used in the database, which makes it vulnerable to injection attacks.
    The secure.js file address this via a try catch block that will catch any errors. 

You can validate user input or sanitize user input, or stop the call if the user input contains unallowed characters.
